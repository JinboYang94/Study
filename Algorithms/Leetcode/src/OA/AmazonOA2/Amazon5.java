/**
 * In Amazonâ€™s sort center, a computer system decides what packages are to be loaded on what trucks.
 * All rooms and spaces are abstracted into space units which is represented as an integer.
 * For each type of truck, they have different space units. For each package,
 * they will be occupying different space units.
 * As a software development engineer in sort centers, you will need to write a method:
 * Given truck space units and a list of product space units,
 * find out exactly TWO products that fit into the truck.
 * You will also implement an internal rule that the truck has to reserve exactly 30 space units
 * for safety purposes. Each package is assigned a unique ID, numbered from 0 to N-1.
 * Assumptions:
 * You will pick up exactly 2 packages.
 * You cannot pick up one package twice.
 * If you have multiple pairs, select the pair with the largest package.
 * Input:
 * The input to the function/method consists of two arguments :
 * truckSpace , an integer representing the truck space.
 * packagesSpace , a list of integers representing the space units occupying by packages.
 * Output:
 * Return a list of integers representing the IDs of two packages whose combined space will leave
 * exactly 30 space units on the truck.
 *
 * <p>
 * Example:
 * Input:
 * truckSpace = 90
 * packagesSpace = [1, 10, 25, 35, 60]
 * Output: [2, 3]
 * Explanation : Given a truck of 90 space units, a list of packages space units
 * [1, 10, 25, 35, 60], Your method should select the third(ID-2) and fourth(ID-3)
 * package since you have to reserve exactly 30 space units.
 * </p>
