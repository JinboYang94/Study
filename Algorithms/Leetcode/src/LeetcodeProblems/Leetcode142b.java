/**
 * O(1) solution.
 * Explanation:
 * When slow meets fast, from meeting point to loop ending point: x1
 * from loop starting point to meeting point: x2
 * from head to loop starting/ending point: x3
 * 1------->2------->3----->4
 *   x3     â†‘      x2       |
 *          |---------------|
 *                 x1
 * Relationship: when meets, fast moves x3 + x2 + x1 + x2, slow moves x3 + x2
 *               x3 + x2 + x1 + x2 = 2 * (x3 + x2)
 *               so we get x1 = x3
 * Here set slow to head, equally move slow and fast, when they meet that's the loop point.
